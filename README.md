Pokémon is a turn based battle game between two players with a team of six Pokémon, each having four moves that deal a different amount of damage. In this adaptation of the game, your Pokémon is chosen randomly as you battle until one player has no Pokémon left.

Game Summary: 

The page loads and each team sends out a random Pokémon. Then each player takes turns clicking on what move they want to use and you will see the opposite Pokémon's HP reflect the damage just done to them. The 'protagonist' is the team on the left and the antagonist is the team on the right. The two teams are based off of Pokémon Platinum, with the left team being my original team (with slight modifications) and the right team being Cynthia's team (with slight modifications).

Lessons/Ongoing Issues: 

Creating a 'Sandbox' Pokémon game
    
    - Initially the game was supposed to be a create your own team type of game. After many API calls and object creations I realized that I didn't quite know how to handle all of that so I changed it to two already defined teams.
    - I had issues picking an opponent move at random so I made it player vs. player although it originally was going to be player vs. computer
    
Future Plans

    - I have plans in the near future to create my original image where you pick your team to battle against Cynthia
    - I also want to add types to all of the Pokémon and to the moves

Lessons learned

    - Start very simple. I had to restart this entire project a day before it's due date because I started with too much. In hindsight it may not have actually been too much if I was better at managing my time
